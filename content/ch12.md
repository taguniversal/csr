This chapter presents a symbol string language of direct association relationships that embodies the invocation model.

## 2.1 THE NATURE OF SYMBOL STRING EXPRESSION

The essential property of a symbol string is that it exists in an inherently limiting one-dimensional expression space. A symbol in the string can associate with its direct neighbors but cannot directly associate with more remote places in the string, Contrast this to the expression of an electronic circuit in three-dimensional space in which any place in the circuit can directly associate with any other place in the circuit via a wire connecting the two places.

A symbol string expression must be mappable to higher dimensional forms of expression. So there must be a means of expressing higher dimensional relationships in the one-dimensional string, a means of delimiting places within the string, and a means of associating these places from anywhere in the string to anywhere else in the string. This is accomplished with syntax structure and with name correspondence

Of the available symbols a small set is reserved for expressing syntax structures, and the rest can be used for expressing correspondence names and the content that flows through the expression. Syntax structure can express delimitation of places and their local association in terms of nesting and contiguity, but it cannot associate one place in the expression with arbitrary place in the expression. This is accomplished with name correspondence association. Each syntax structure has a unique name. Remote syntax structures with identical names are associated by the correspondence of their names.

Another consequence of the one-dimensionality of the symbol string is that there is not enough dimensionality for a symbol string expression to autonomously resolve in the context of the string. A symbol string expression can be mapped into an expression with sufficient dimensionality, or it can be interpreted within an expression of sufficient dimensionality. However, a symbol string cannot spontaneously behave on its own merits A symbol string expression is a purely referential form of expression.

Since a symbol string is purely referential it can indulge in efficiencies that are not available to expressions that autonomously It can express just the necessary relationships of a process and defer as universal conventions many of the details of process behavior. The deferred expressivity can be added back in during mapping to autonomy or interpretation.

## 12.2 A LANGUAGE OF ASSOCIATION RELATIONSHIPS

The invocation language embodies the invocation model. It expresses association relationships among places in an expression in contrast to a sequence of operations on a state space. It expresses distributed concurrency in contrast to centralized sequentiality. It expresses locally autonomous behavior in contrast to centrally controlled behavior. It expresses distributed data maintenance in contrast to centralized data maintenance Expression in the language is uniform and consistent from primitive expressions such as logic functions or protein interactions through all levels of hierarchical composition.

There are several familiar notions of expressivity that the language does not include. There is no predefined set of symbols, no predefined set of primitive operators, no predefined data types or structures, and no predefined control operators. There is no concept of sequence or of any time referent No concept of explicit control. no concept of explicitly addressable memory, and no concept of state space.

Expressions in the invocation language can be mapped into any form of implementation from a fully distributed and concurrent pipeline structure to a contemporary sequential processor and onto any intermediate flavor of distributed processing such as multiple core sequential processors. DSPs and programmable gate arrays. Uncluttered with conventions and confusions the invocation language captures the elegant simplicity of expressing concurrent and distributed behavior encompassing all forms of process expression from mathematical computation to biological metabolism.

## 12.3 THE SYNTAX STRUCTURES

There are four syntax structures the source place, the destination place. the invocation. and the definition. A source place anywhere in the string is laterally associated by name correspondence to one or more destination places.Boundaries within the network are expressed with an invocation. One or more destination places are associated as an input boundary. and one or more source places are associated as an output boundary. The invocation boundaries laterally associate with other invocations and hierarchically associate by name correspondence to a definition that contains the expression between the input and output boundaries of the invocation.

### 12.3.1 Lateral Composition: Place-to-Place Association

Non-neighbor places in the string are associated by name correspondence between a source place and one or more destination places. Sourcename is the correspondence name of the source place and destinationname is the correspondence name of the destination place.

Source place: `sourcename<content>`

Destination place: $destinationname

A source place will associate with all destination places with an identical correspondence name. The behavior model is that the content of a source place flows to each destination place of the same name. In Figure 12.1a AGXST is the content of a source place named Abel. Source place Abel< > is associated with one destination place $Abel by name correspondence. The AGXST will flow from source Abel< > to destination place $Abel. Figure 12.1b shows a source place named Baker with a content NGRYU with a fan-out association by name correspondence to three destination places named Baker. The content. NGRYU. will flow to all three destination places.

A single correspondence name can span only one association There cannot be two source places of the same name. 

Figure 12.2a illustrates the ambiguity of identically named source places.

Figure 12.2 Daisy chaining associations

To extend a path of association. a destination place associates with a differently named source place by syntax association Figure 12.2b shows a source place first<> with a content FSZPO that is associated with destination $first by name correspondence association. Destination place $first is associated with source place second<> by syntax structure association. Source place second<> is associated with destination place $second by name correspondence association Destination place $second is associated with source place third<> by syntax structure association. Source place third<> is associated with destination place $third by name correspondence association The FSZPQ in source place first<> ultimately flows through the associations to destination place Sthird.

Different syntax structures are associated by name correspondence and different correspondence names are associated by syntax structure Extended paths of association are expressed by alternating name correspondence association and syntax structure association. weaving a tapestry of arbitrarily complex association relationships in a one-dimensional string of symbols.

### 12.3.2 Hierarchical Composition: The Invocation and Definition

The invocation and definition express the boundaries of both lateral and hierarchical composition.

The Invocation - The invocation associates destination places to form an input boundary and associates source places to form an output boundary. The behavior model is that the boundaries are completeness boundaries and that the invocation expresses completeness criterion behavior between its input and output boundaries When the content at the output boundary is complete the content presented to the input is complete. and the output is the correct resolution of the content presented to the input boundary. Invocation boundaries are the boundaries of the expression. They are composition boundaries, coordination boundaries, and partition boundaries.

An invocation is a named syntax structure of two parenthesized lists. Invocationname is the correspondence name of the invocation The destination list is the input boundary for the invocation. in which the content to be resolved is received and the source list is the output boundary for the invocation, through which the result content is distributed.

Invocation - invocationname(destination list)(source list)

Figure 12.3 shows the syntax structure of the invocation and its external association relationships. ProcX is the correspondence name of the invocation that associates with a definition of the same name.

### The Definition
The definition expresses the network of associations between the boundaries of the associated invocation. A definition is a named syntax structure delimited by brackets containing a source list delimited by parenthesis, a destination list delimited by parenthesis. a place of resolution terminated by a colon followed by a place of contained definitions Definitionname is the correspondence name of the definition. The source list is the input for the definition through which a formed name is received, and the destination list is the output for the definition through which the results are delivered The place of resolution is best understood as a bounded pure value expression that can contain association expressions.

definition - definitionname[(source list) (destination list) place of resolution : contained definitions]

A definition associates to an invocation by name correspondence The place of resolution contains the expression between the boundaries that resolves the presented input to an asserted output. The source list receives the input contents by correspondence of syntax structure from an invocation destination list and associates them to destination places in the resolving expression in the place of resolution. The resolving expression contains source places that associate to the output destination places. The destination list receives the results from the source places of the resolving expression and returns them by correspondence of syntax structure to the invocation source list.

Resolving expression in place of resolution

Figure 12.4 shows the syntax structure of the definition and its internal association relationships ProcX is the correspondence name of the definition and associates with a invocation of the same name.

### 12.3.3 The Association of Invocation and Definition

An invocation associates by name correspondence to an identically named definition The lists of the invocation associate with the lists of the definition by syntactic structure The source list of the definition associates to the destination list of the invocation by order correspondence The destination list of the definition associates to the source list of the invocation by order correspondence. This might seem somewhat confusing at first, but the rationale is straightforward.

In Figure 12.5a the invocation ABC associates by name correspondence to definition ABC Destination places of the invocation destination list associate by order with the source places of the definition source list. Source places of the invocation source list associate by order with the destination places of the definition destination list. The destination list of the invocation is places to where contents flow to form the content to be resolved The source list of the definition is the places from which the content flows to the resolving expression. The destination list of the definition is the places to where the results of the resolving expression will flow. and the source list of the invocation is the places from which results will flow to their destinations

Figure 12.5b gives a graphic representation of the invocation-definition syntactic interface

The interface relationships can also be understood in terms of daisychaining. Figure 12.5c shows the invocation and definition lists with destination places merged into their associated source places showing the relationship of the invocation and definition boundaries in terms of syntactic daisychaining

Because its interface of association places with the external expression is purely syntactic, a definition forms an isolated correspondence name domain for source places and destination places. Internal names can be chosen without concern that there will be ambiguity with the external expression.

Figure 12.4 shows the syntax structure of the definition and its internal

12.3.3 The Association of Invocation and Definition

An invocation associates by name correspondence to an identically name

definition The lists of the invocation associate with the lists of the definition

by syntactic structure The source list of the definition associates to the desti

nation list of the invocation by order correspondence. The destination list of

the definition associates to the source list of the invocation by order come

spondence. This might seem somewhat confusing at first, but the rationale

straightforward.

In Figure 12.5a the invocation ABC associates by name correspondence

to definition ABC. Destination places of the invocation destination limit

associate by order with the source places of the definition source list. Source

places of the invocation source list associate by order with the destination

places of the definition destination list. The destination list of the invocation

is places to where contents flow to form the content to be resolved The

source list of the definition is the places from which the content flows to the

resolving expression. The destination list of the definition is the places to

where the results of the resolving expression will flow. and the source list of

the invocation is the places from which results will flow to their destinations

Figure 12.5b gives a graphic representation of the invocation-definition sys

tactic interface.

The interface relationships can also be understood in terms of daisychain

ing. Figure 12.5g shows the invocation and definition lists with destination

places merged into their associated source places showing the relationship of

the invocation and definition boundaries in terms of syntactic daisychaining

Because its interface of association places with the external expression is

purely syntactic, a definition forms an isolated correspondence name domain

for source places and destination places. Internal names can be chosen without

concern that there will be ambiguity with the external expression.

The invocation and definition syntax structures can be abbreviated to express

simpler association relationships and also to accommodate familiar forms of

symbol string expression.

Return a Content to Place of Invocation An unnamed source place in the

source place list of an invocation associates by implicit name correspondence

to the place of the invocation and no other place. The invocation itself becomes

the single destination place for the returned result. In Example 12.1 the first

source place in the source list of the invocation is unnamed The destination

place $SUM in the destination list of the definition associates to the unnamed

source place. The content flowing through $SUM will associate to the unnamed

source place and flow to the place of the invocation

Single Return to Place of Invocation If an invocation receives a single

result in its own place, there is no need of a source list. The corresponding

Example 12.3 Further abbreviated expression of a single return to place of invocation

<OR(AND(NOT(SX).SY)AND(SX.NOT(SY)))>

Example 12.4 Nested invocations

definition can express the single return with the absence of a destination line

and with the presence of a single unnamed source place in the place of resols

tion. An expression like Example 12.2 can be further abbreviated to the form

of Example 12.3

This abbreviation supports the familiar expressional form of functional

nesting. In Example 12.4 each invocation has only a destination list and is part

of the destination list of another invocation or is within a source place.

The Conditional Invocation Name If an invocation has an empty destina-

tion list. i.e. no input. then the invocationname itself must express the variable

part of the invocation The conditional invocationname is the mechanism of

content transformation in the language. The invocation correspondence name

is formed from the content of one or more contiguous destination places

Content emerges from flow paths to interact by forming the correspondence

name of an invocation All content flowing through the association paths

eventually emerges to form an invocation correspondence name. This is how

value transform rules are invoked to transform the flowing content of the

expression

The Constant Definition If a definition does not contain a source list and

does not contain a definition list. it is a constant definition With no input

associations there is no content flow into the definition to resolve no need for

internal definitions. and no need for the colon. A constant definition contains

only a place of resolution between the brackets which contains a constant

content and can be abbreviated as shown below:

definitionname [constant]

Example 12.5 OR function with value transform rule definitions.

Example 12.6 Fan-out steering.

Since invocation. there is no destination list, the constant content is returned to the place

A constant definition rule expresses a value transform rule. Example 12.5

value transform definitions for the AND function. The shows

or will propagate that through A< > and B< >, and a two-value content values

formed by $A$B() invoked definition will invoke one of the contained definitions. name The will be

stant of the will return to the place of the invocation, con-

a llow path in the unnamed source place, and will flow through the unnamed enter-

source place back to the invocation of AND. The set of constant defini-

sons-value transform rule definitions-expresses the truth table of the AND

function. One can think of the content forming the invocationname that trans-

forms into the content of the definition.

A constant definition can also contain a fragment of expression including

an invocation that will be returned to the place of invocation. The formation

of an invocationname in a place of resolution results in the fragment of expres-

sion in the corresponding constant definition being returned to the place of

invocation in the place of resolution and consequently being resolved. In

Example 12.6 the content of select< > will be A or B. This content flows to

Seelect and forms the invocation A( or B(), invoking one of the two con-

tained definitions. The content of the named definition is returned to the place

of invocation in the place of resolution and resolved directing the input to one

of two possible output association paths.

The Pure Value Expression If there are no list parenthesis in a place of

resolution, then there are no explicit invocations. The contents flowing into a

place of resolution are assumed to be freely associating values of a pure value

expression that will form names of contained definitions. The contained defini-

tions are value transform rules, or they contain association expression frag-

ments to be inserted into the place of resolution.

The place of resolution of Example 12.26, as seen later in this chapter, contains

pure value expression.
